    "details": "A vulnerability was discovered in the odoh-rs rust crate that stems\nfrom faulty logic during the parsing of encrypted queries. This\nissue specifically occurs when processing encrypted query data\nreceived from remote clients.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker with knowledge of this vulnerability could craft and send\nspecially designed encrypted queries to targeted ODOH servers running\nwith odoh-rs. Upon successful exploitation, the server will crash\nabruptly, disrupting its normal operation and rendering the service\ntemporarily unavailable.\n\n## Patches\n\nUsers are encouraged to update their odoh-rs's rust crate to v1.0.2.",
