    "summary": "Timing side-channel in ML-DSA decomposition",
    "details": "### Summary\n\nA timing side-channel was discovered in the Decompose algorithm which is used during ML-DSA signing to generate hints for the signature.\n\n### Details\n\nThe analysis was performed using a constant-time analyzer that examines compiled assembly code for instructions with data-dependent timing behavior. The analyzer flags:\n\n- **UDIV/SDIV instructions**: Hardware division instructions have early termination optimizations where execution time depends on operand values.\n\nThe `decompose` function used a hardware division instruction to compute `r1.0 / TwoGamma2::U32`. This function is called during signing through `high_bits()` and `low_bits()`, which process values derived from secret key components:\n\n- `(&w - &cs2).low_bits()` where `cs2` is derived from secret key component `s2`\n- `Hint::new()` calls `high_bits()` on values derived from secret key component `t0`\n\n**Original Code**:\n```rust\nfn decompose<TwoGamma2: Unsigned>(self) -> (Elem, Elem) {\n    // ...\n    let mut r1 = r_plus - r0;\n    r1.0 /= TwoGamma2::U32;  // Variable-time division on secret-derived data\n    (r1, r0)\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThe dividend (`r1.0`) is derived from secret key material. An attacker with precise timing measurements could extract information about the signing key by observing timing variations in the division operation.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nInteger division was replaced with a constant-time Barrett reduction.",
