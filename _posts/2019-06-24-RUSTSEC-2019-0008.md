### Description

The affected version of this crate did not guard against accessing memory
beyond the range of its input data. A pointer cast to read the data into
a 256-bit register could lead to a segmentation fault when the end plus
the 32 bytes (256 bit) read would overlap into the next page during string
parsing.

```
page   |  ...  page 1  ...  | ... page 2  ... |
data   | x[n * 32 byte]xx__ |                 |
access | ..][ 32 byte ]     |                 |
segflt |               [ 32 | byte ]          |
```

This allows an attacker to eventually crash a service.

The flaw was corrected by using a padding buffer for the last read from the
input. So that we are we never read over the boundary of the input data.
