### Description

`ncurses` exposes functions from the ncurses library which:

- Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of
  data, leading to a buffer overflow. (`instr`, `mvwinstr`, etc)
- Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile
  input to execute a format string attack, which trivially allows writing
  arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the `printw` family).
