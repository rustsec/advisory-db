### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic tags were nested excessively during deserialization.

This allows an attacker to craft small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow.
 
The flaw was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.
