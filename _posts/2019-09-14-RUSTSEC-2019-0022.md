### Description

Affected versions of this crate is not panic safe within callback functions `stream_callback` and `stream_finished_callback`.

The call to user-provided closure might panic before a `mem::forget` call, which then causes a use after free that grants attacker to control the callback function pointer.

This allows an attacker to construct an arbitrary code execution .
 
The flaw was reported by Phosphorus15.
