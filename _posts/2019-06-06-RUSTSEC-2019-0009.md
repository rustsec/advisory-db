### Description

Attempting to call `grow` on a spilled SmallVec with a value equal to the current capacity causes it to free the existing data. This performs a double free immediately and may lead to use-after-free on subsequent accesses to the SmallVec contents.

An attacker that controls the value passed to `grow` may exploit this flaw to obtain memory contents or gain remote code execution.

Credits to @ehuss for discovering, reporting and fixing the bug.
