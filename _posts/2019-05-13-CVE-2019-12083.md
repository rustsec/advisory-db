### Description

The Rust team was recently notified of a security vulnerability affecting
manual implementations of `Error::type_id` and their interaction with the
`Error::downcast` family of functions in the standard library. If your code
does not manually implement `Error::type_id` your code is not affected.

## Overview

The `Error::type_id` function in the standard library was stabilized in the
1.34.0 release on 2019-04-11. This function allows acquiring the concrete
`TypeId` for the underlying error type to downcast back to the original type.
This function has a default implementation in the standard library, but it can
also be overridden by downstream crates. For example, the following is
currently allowed on Rust 1.34.0 and Rust 1.34.1:

```
struct MyType;

impl Error for MyType {
    fn type_id(&self) -> TypeId {
        // Enable safe casting to `String` by accident.
        TypeId::of::<String>()
    }
}
```

When combined with the `Error::downcast*` family of methods this can enable
safe casting of a type to the wrong type, causing security issues such as out
of bounds reads/writes/etc.

Prior to the 1.34.0 release this function was not stable and could not be
either implemented or called in stable Rust.

## Affected Versions

The `Error::type_id` function was first stabilized in Rust 1.34.0, released on
2019-04-11. The Rust 1.34.1 release, published 2019-04-25, is also affected.
The `Error::type_id` function has been present, unstable, for all releases of
Rust since 1.0.0 meaning code compiled with nightly may have been affected at
any time.

## Mitigations

Immediate mitigation of this bug requires removing manual implementations of
`Error::type_id`, instead inheriting the default implementation which is
correct from a safety perspective. It is not the intention to have
`Error::type_id` return `TypeId` instances for other types.

For long term mitigation we are going to destabilize this function. This is
unfortunately a breaking change for users calling `Error::type_id` and for
users overriding `Error::type_id`. For users overriding it's likely memory
unsafe, but users calling `Error::type_id` have only been able to do so on
stable for a few weeks since the last 1.34.0 release, so it's thought that the
impact will not be too great to overcome.

We will be releasing a 1.34.2 point release on 2019-05-14 (tomorrow) which
reverts [#58048][1] and destabilizes the `Error::type_id` function. The
upcoming 1.35.0 release along with the beta/nightly channels will also all be
updated with a destabilization.

The final fate of the `Error::type_id` API isn't decided upon just yet and is
the subject of [#60784][2]. No action beyond destabilization is currently
planned so nightly code may continue to exhibit this issue. We hope to fully
resolve this in the standard library soon.
