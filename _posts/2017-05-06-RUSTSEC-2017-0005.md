description: "Affected versions of this crate use the time crate and the method Durationseconds to parse the MaxAge duration cookie setting. This method will panic if the value is greater than 2641000 and less than or equal to 264, which can result in denial of service for a client or server. This flaw was corrected by explicitly checking for the MaxAge being in this integer range and clamping the value to the maximum duration value."

### Description

Affected versions of this crate use the `time` crate and the method
`Duration::seconds` to parse the `Max-Age` duration cookie setting. This method
will panic if the value is greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to
2^64, which can result in denial of service for a client or server.

This flaw was corrected by explicitly checking for the `Max-Age` being in this
integer range and clamping the value to the maximum duration value.
