# lockfree crate is unsound and unmaintained

Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` to construct `Removable<T>`.
This is unsound.

In addition, the `lockfree` crate is no longer actively maintained.  If you rely on this crate, consider switching to a recommended alternative.
