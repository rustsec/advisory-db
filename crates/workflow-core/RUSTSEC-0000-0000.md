# Create illegal slice by util function

The util functions `buffer_as_slice` and `buffer_as_slice_mut` in crate 
`workflow-core` are very powerful and useful to get slice of other types 
but are rather unsafe as well:

1. The pointer calculation with `byte_offset` could lead to alignment problem, which is an undefined behavior.

2. The `from_raw_parts` could create an out-of-bound slice that allows the user to access or even change the memory illegally.
