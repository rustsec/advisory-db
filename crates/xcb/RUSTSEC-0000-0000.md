# `xcb::Connection::connect_to_fd*` functions violate I/O safety

The API of `xcb::Connection` has constructors which allow an arbitrary `RawFd`
to be used as a socket connection. On either failure of these constructors or
on the drop of `Connection`, it closes the associated file descriptor. Thus, a
program which uses an `OwnedFd` (such as a `UnixStream`) as the file descriptor
can close the file descriptor and continue to attempt using it or close an
already-closed file descriptor, violating I/O safety.

Starting in version 1.6.0, `xcb` provides `Connection::connect_with_fd` and
`Connection::connect_with_fd_and_extensions` as safe alternatives and
deprecates the problematic functions.
