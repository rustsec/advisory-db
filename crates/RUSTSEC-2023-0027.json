  "summary": "TLS certificate common name validation bypass",
  "details": "The NATS official Rust clients are vulnerable to MitM when using TLS.\n\nThe common name of the server's TLS certificate is validated against\nthe `host`name provided by the server's plaintext `INFO` message\nduring the initial connection setup phase. A MitM proxy can tamper with\nthe `host` field's value by substituting it with the common name of a\nvalid certificate it controls, fooling the client into accepting it.\n\n## Reproduction steps\n\n1. The NATS Rust client tries to establish a new connection\n2. The connection is intercepted by a MitM proxy\n3. The proxy makes a separate connection to the NATS server\n4. The NATS server replies with an `INFO` message\n5. The proxy reads the `INFO`, alters the `host` JSON field and passes\n   the tampered `INFO` back to the client\n6. The proxy upgrades the client connection to TLS, presenting a certificate issued\n   by a certificate authority present in the client's keychain.\n   In the previous step the `host` was set to the common name of said certificate\n7. `rustls` accepts the certificate, having verified that the common name matches the\n   attacker-controlled value it was given\n9. The client has been fooled by the MitM proxy into accepting the attacker-controlled certificate",
