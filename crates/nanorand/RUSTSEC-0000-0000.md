# nanorand 0.5.0 - RNGs failed to generate properly for non-64-bit numbers

In versions of `nanorand` prior to 0.5.1, `RandomGen` implementations for standard unsigned integers could
fail to properly generate numbers, due to using bit-shifting to truncate a 64-bit number, rather than just
an `as` conversion.

This often manifested as RNGs returning nothing but 0, including the cryptographically secure `ChaCha` random
number generator..
