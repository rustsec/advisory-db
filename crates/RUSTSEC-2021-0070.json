  "summary": "VecStorage Deserialize Allows Violation of Length Invariant",
  "details": "The `Deserialize` implementation for `VecStorage` did not maintain the invariant that the number of elements must equal `nrows * ncols`. Deserialization of specially crafted inputs could allow memory access beyond allocation of the vector.\n\nThis flaw was introduced in v0.11.0 ([`086e6e`](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/commit/086e6e719f53fecba6dadad2e953a487976387f5)) due to the addition of an automatically derived implementation of `Deserialize` for `MatrixVec`. `MatrixVec` was later renamed to `VecStorage` in v0.16.13 ([`0f66403`](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/commit/0f66403cbbe9eeac15cedd8a906c0d6a3d8841f2)) and continued to use the automatically derived implementation of `Deserialize`.\n\nThis flaw was corrected in commit [`5bff536`](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/commit/5bff5368bf38ddfa31416e4ae9897b163031a513) by returning an error during deserialization if the number of elements does not exactly match the expected size.",
