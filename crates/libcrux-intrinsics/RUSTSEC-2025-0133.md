# Incorrect calculation on aarch64

On platforms without the `core::arch::aarch64::vxarq_u64` intrinsic, an unverified fallback in `libcrux-intrinsics` v0.0.3
passed incorrect arguments and produced wrong results. This corrupted SHA-3 digests and caused `libcrux-ml-kem` and
`libcrux-ml-dsa` to sample incorrectly, yielding incorrect shared secrets and invalid signatures.

The issue has been fixed in v0.0.4.
