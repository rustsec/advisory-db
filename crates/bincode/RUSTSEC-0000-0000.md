Development on bincode has ceased permanently, and updates will only be made in the event of a CVE. Projects are encouraged to migrate to alternatives such as `postcard` if possible. If compatibilty with the bincode format is required, consider using `wincode`.

## Alternatives

- [wincode](https://crates.io/crates/wincode) - Bincode-compatible alternative
- [postcard](https://crates.io/crates/postcard)
- [rkyv](https://crates.io/crates/rkyv)
