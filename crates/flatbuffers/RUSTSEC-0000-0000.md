# Generated code can read and write out of bounds in safe code

Code generated by flatbuffers' compiler is `unsafe` but not marked as such.
See https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6627 for details.

All users that use generated code by `flatbuffers` compiler are recommended to:
1. not expose flatbuffer generated code as part of their public APIs
2. audit their code and look for any usage of `follow`, `push`, or any method that uses them
   (e.g. `self_follow`).
3. Carefuly go through the crates' documentation to understand which "safe" APIs are not
   intended to be used.
