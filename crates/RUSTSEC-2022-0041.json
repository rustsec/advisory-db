  "summary": "Unsoundness of AtomicCell<*64> arithmetics on 32-bit targets that support Atomic*64",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nAffected versions of this crate incorrectly assumed that the alignment of {i,u}64 was always the same as Atomic{I,U}64.\n\nHowever, the alignment of {i,u}64 on a 32-bit target can be smaller than Atomic{I,U}64.\n\nThis can cause the following problems:\n\n- Unaligned memory accesses\n- Data race\n\nCrates using fetch_* methods with AtomicCell<{i,u}64> are affected by this issue.\n\n32-bit targets without Atomic{I,U}64 and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue.\n\n32-bit targets with Atomic{I,U}64 and {i,u}64 have the same alignment are also not affected by this issue.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the builtin targets that may be affected. (last update: nightly-2022-02-11)\n\n- armv7-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- armv7s-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- i386-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- i586-unknown-linux-gnu\n- i586-unknown-linux-musl\n- i686-apple-darwin (tier 3)\n- i686-linux-android\n- i686-unknown-freebsd\n- i686-unknown-haiku (tier 3)\n- i686-unknown-linux-gnu\n- i686-unknown-linux-musl\n- i686-unknown-netbsd (tier 3)\n- i686-unknown-openbsd (tier 3)\n- i686-wrs-vxworks (tier 3)\n\n([script to get list](https://gist.github.com/taiki-e/3c7891e8c5f5e0cbcb44d7396aabfe10))\n\n## Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7.\n\nAffected 0.8.x releases have been yanked.\n\nThanks to @taiki-e",
