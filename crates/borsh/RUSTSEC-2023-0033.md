# Parsing borsh messages with ZST which are not-copy/clone is unsound

Affected versions of borsh cause undefined behavior when zero-sized-types (ZST) 
are parsed and the Copy/Clone traits are not implemented/derived.
For instance if 1000 instances of a ZST are deserialized, and the ZST is not copy 
(this can be achieved through a singleton), then accessing/writing to deserialized 
data will cause a segmentation fault.

There is currently no way for borsh to read data without also providing a Rust type. 
Therefore, if not ZST are used for serialization, then you are not affected by this issue.
