# Broadcast channel calls clone in parallel, but does not require `Sync`

The broadcast channel internally calls `clone` on the stored value when
receiving it, and only requires `T:Send`. This means that using the broadcast
channel with values that are `Send` but not `Sync` can trigger unsoundness if
the `clone` implementation makes use of the value being `!Sync`.

Thank you to Austin Bonander for finding and reporting this issue.
