# tandem is unmaintained

The tandem crates in [https://github.com/sine-fdn](github.com/sine-fdn) are no longer maintained by the SINE Foundation. The repository has been archived.

## Recommended alternative
We are continuing our work on SMPC by implementing our secure multi-party computation engine [Polytune](https://github.com/sine-fdn/polytune).
