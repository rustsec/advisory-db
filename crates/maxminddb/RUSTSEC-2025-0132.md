# `Reader::open_mmap` unsoundly marks unsafe memmap operation as safe

maxminddb prior to version 0.27 declared `Reader::open_mmap` as safe 
despite wrapping an inherently unsafe memmap2 operation with no
extra step done to guarantee safety. This could have led to undefined
behaviour if the file were to be modified on disk while the memory map
was still active.
