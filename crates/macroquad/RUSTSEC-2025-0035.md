# Multiple soundness issues in `macroquad`

Several soundness issues have been reported. Resolving them doesn't seem to be considered a priority. In particular, unprincipled use of
mutable statics is pervasive throughout the library, making it possible to cause use-after-free in safe code.

Currently, no fixed version is available.
