  "summary": "Unsound use of str::from_utf8_unchecked on bytes which are not UTF-8",
  "details": "Affected versions receive a `&[u8]` from the caller through a safe API, and pass\nit directly to the unsafe `str::from_utf8_unchecked` function.\n\nThe behavior of `ferris_says::say` is undefined if the bytes from the caller\ndon't happen to be valid UTF-8.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in [ferris-says#21] by using the safe `str::from_utf8`\ninstead, and returning an error on invalid input. However this fix has not yet\nbeen published to crates.io as a patch version for 0.2.\n\nSeparately, [ferris-says#32] has introduced a different API for version 0.3\nwhich accepts input as `&str` rather than `&[u8]`, so is unaffected by this bug.\n\n[ferris-says#21]: https://github.com/rust-lang/ferris-says/pull/21\n[ferris-says#32]: https://github.com/rust-lang/ferris-says/pull/32",
