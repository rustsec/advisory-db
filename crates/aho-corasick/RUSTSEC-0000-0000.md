# Out-of-bounds access

Out-of-bounds access in the "find_in()" function of "Searcher" struct in "src/packed/api.rs:537", where "haystack[len]" does not check the user-provided value "len". Setting "len" to be greater than the length of 'haystack" causes denial of service.

The vulnerability can be explited by setting "len" to be greater than the size of "haystack". Rust's bounds checking prevents further undefined behaviours, but it can still cause denial of service.

The flaw can be corrected by adding a boundary checking in `aho_corasick::packed::Searcher::find_in`.
