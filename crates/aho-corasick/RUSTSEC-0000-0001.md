# Integer overflow in the offset()

Integer overflow in the `offset()` function of Span struct in "src/util/search.rs:714". The addition of two usize variables without range checking at `Span { start: self.start + offset, end: self.end + offset }` may cause denial of service.

The vulnerability can be exploited by setting `start` and `end` variables of a `Span` instance to large numbers, such as usize::MAX - 10, and then setting `offset` variables to a large number as well. The vulnerability can be triggered by calling "offset()".

This flaw can be corrected by adding a range checking in the `offset()` function.
