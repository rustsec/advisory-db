# serde crate is effectively unmaintained

The `serde` crate has been effectively unmaintained for a long time: the created PRs are not reviewed
by the owners/maintainers of the repository, the created issues does not receive any feedback from them.
Rarely, commits concern infrastructure support, so we can conclude that the author(s) see the new
issues/PRs, but do not react to them in any way, even after several reminders.

Even PRs, which are trivial fixes that take a maximum of 5 minutes to review, do not receive attention,
confirmed bugs with a reproduction example and a [confirmed fix], in my opinion, many of them should
not take more than 30 minutes to review.

## Examples of PRs without any attention from maintainers:

- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2295
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2367
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2476
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2513 (usability issue fix)
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2561 (usability issue fix)
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2781
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2929 (changes only in tests)
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2931 (refactoring, but personally allows me to work on other PRs without being distracted by small details, trivial)
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2933
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2936 (refactoring, but personally allows me to work on other PRs without being distracted by small details, trivial)
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2937 (usability issue fix, trivial)

## Examples of PRs which was reviewed, but then abandoned by mainteiners

- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/1922
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2520 (bug fix, maintainers agreed that the fix is correct, but after that it has been ignored for almost 2 years even after several reminders)
- https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2922 (usability issue fix)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given that `serde` is used in most crates in the Rust ecosystem, it is important to keep it maintained:
respond to community requests in a timely manner and provide feedback for PRs. Unfortunately, current
maintainers (who is officially unknown for average user of GitHub, because this information is not
public, or I don't know where to see it) do not acknowledge the problem and do not respond to any
attempts to offer maintenance assistance, or simply to raise this question in a public space.

[confirmed fix]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/pull/2520
