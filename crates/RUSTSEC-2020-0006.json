  "summary": "Flaw in `realloc` allows reading unknown memory",
  "details": "When `realloc`ing, if we allocate new space, we need to copy the old\nallocation's bytes into the new space. There are `old_size` number of bytes in\nthe old allocation, but we were accidentally copying `new_size` number of bytes,\nwhich could lead to copying bytes into the realloc'd space from past the chunk\nthat we're bump allocating out of, from unknown memory.\n\nIf an attacker can cause `realloc`s, and can read the `realoc`ed data back,\nthis could allow them to read things from other regions of memory that they\nshouldn't be able to. For example, if some crypto keys happened to live in\nmemory right after a chunk we were bump allocating out of, this could allow\nthe attacker to read the crypto keys.\n\nBeyond just fixing the bug and adding a regression test, I've also taken two\nadditional steps:\n\n1. While we were already running the testsuite under `valgrind` in CI, because\n   `valgrind` exits with the same code that the program did, if there are\n   invalid reads/writes that happen not to trigger a segfault, the program can\n   still exit OK and we will be none the wiser. I've enabled the\n   `--error-exitcode=1` flag for `valgrind` in CI so that tests eagerly fail\n   in these scenarios.\n\n2. I've written a quickcheck test to exercise `realloc`. Without the bug fix\n   in this patch, this quickcheck immediately triggers invalid reads when run\n   under `valgrind`. We didn't previously have quickchecks that exercised\n   `realloc` because `realloc` isn't publicly exposed directly, and instead\n   can only be indirectly called. This new quickcheck test exercises `realloc`\n   via `bumpalo::collections::Vec::resize` and\n   `bumpalo::collections::Vec::shrink_to_fit` calls.",
