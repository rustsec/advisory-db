# Undefined Behavior by Safe Function `from_mdb_value`

The implementation of `FromMdbValue` for `Vec<u8>` calls `slice::from_raw_parts` without validating the pointer or length.
This allows creating a slice from an invalid pointer (e.g. dangling or null), leading to Undefined Behavior even when called from safe code.

The issue was reported in [issue #69](https://github.com/vhbit/lmdb-rs/issues/69) with a PoC demonstrating UB using `miri`.

This vulnerability affects the same function `from_mdb_value` that was previously reported and had a proposed fix in [issue #67](https://github.com/vhbit/lmdb-rs/issues/67). However, the previous attempts did not fully satisfy safety requirements, indicating a necessity for a more systematic patch.
