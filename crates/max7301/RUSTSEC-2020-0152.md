# ImmediateIO and TransactionalIO can cause data races

The `ImmediateIO` and `TransactionalIO` types implement `Sync` for all contained
`Expander<EI>` types regardless of if the `Expander` itself is safe to use
across threads.

As the `IO` types allow retrieving the `Expander`, this can lead to non-thread
safe types being sent across threads as part of the `Expander` leading to data
races.
