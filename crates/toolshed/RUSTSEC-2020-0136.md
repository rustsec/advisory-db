# CopyCell lacks bounds on its Send trait allowing for data races

`CopyCell<T>` is a `Cell`-like type that is implemented for any type `T` that
is `Copy`able. It's `Send` trait has no bounds on the contained type.

As not all `Copy`able types are thread safe, for example non-mutable references
implement the `Copy` trait, it is possible to send references to types with
interior mutability such as `Cell` across threads and cause data races.
