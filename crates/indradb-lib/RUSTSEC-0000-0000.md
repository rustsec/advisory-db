# Unsound `read_identifier`
The function incorrectly assumes that any `T` could be legal `u8`, then could be used to create legal string with utf8-encoding, causing to out-of-bounds.  

The function is patched by making it `unsafe`, asking user to guarantee the correctness and safety of input before calling the API (commit `4773393`).
