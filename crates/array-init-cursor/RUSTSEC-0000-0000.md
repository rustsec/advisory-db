# `array-init-cursor` in version 0.2.0 and below is unsound when used with types that implement `Drop`

The `Drop` implementation will get run twice when using the cursor.

This issue does not affect you, if you are using only using the crate with
types that are `Copy` such as `u8`.

This issue also does not affect you, if you are only depending on it through
the crate `planus`.
