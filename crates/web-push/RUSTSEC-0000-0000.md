# Denial of Service via malicious Web Push endpoint

Prior to version 0.10.3, the built-in clients of the `web-push` crate
eagerly allocated memory based on the `Content-Length` header returned by the
Web Push endpoint. Malicious Web Push endpoints could return a large
`Content-Length` without ever having to send as much data, leading to
denial of service by memory exhaustion.

Services providing Web Push notifications typically allow the user to
register an arbitrary endpoint, so the endpoint should not be trusted.

The fixed version 0.10.3 now limits the amount of memory it will allocate
for each response, limits the amount of data it will read from the endpoint,
and returns an error if the endpoint sends too much data.

As before, it is recommended that services add a timeout for each request
to Web Push endpoints.
