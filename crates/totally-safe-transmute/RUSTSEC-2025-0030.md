# totally-safe-transmute allows transmuting any type to any other type in safe Rust

This crate uses a known soundness issue (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32670) that will never get fixed. In short, Linux provides a file called `/proc/self/mem` which can be used by a program to modify its own memory. This library modifies an enum variant number by accessing its own memory as a file to effectively transmute a variable.
