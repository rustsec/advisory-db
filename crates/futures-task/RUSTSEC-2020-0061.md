# futures_task::noop_waker_ref can segfault due to dereferencing a NULL pointer

Affected versions of the crate used a `UnsafeCell` in thread-local storage to return a noop waker reference,
assuming that the reference would never be returned from another thread.

This resulted in a segmentation fault crash if `Waker::wake_by_ref()` was called on a waker returned from another thread due to 
it attempting to dereference a pointer that wasn't accesible from the main thread.

Reproduction Example (from issue):
```rust
use futures_task::noop_waker_ref;
fn main() {
    let waker = std::thread::spawn(|| noop_waker_ref()).join().unwrap();
    waker.wake_by_ref();
}
```

The flaw was corrected by using a `OnceCell::Lazy<>` wrapper around the noop waker instead of thread-local storage.
