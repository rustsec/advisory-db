# *ring* is unmaintained

The author has announced an indefinite hiatus in its development, noting that
any reported security vulnerabilities may go unaddressed for prolonged periods
of time.

# Update: security maintenance only

After this advisory was published, the author graciously agreed to give
access to the rustls team. The rustls team is committed to providing
security (only) maintenance for *ring* for the foreseeable future.

# Update: back to normal

Things are more-or-less back to how they were before, and in particular the
situation isn't "security maintenance only."
