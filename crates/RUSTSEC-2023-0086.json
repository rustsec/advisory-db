  "details": "`RUSTSEC-2024-0377` contains multiple soundness issues:\n\n 1. [Bytes::read() allows creating instances of types with invalid bit patterns](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/102)\n 1. [BytesIter::read() advances iterators out of bounds](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/101)\n 1. [The `BytesIter` trait has safety invariants but is public and not marked `unsafe`](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/104)\n 1. [`write_float()` calls `MaybeUninit::assume_init()` on uninitialized data, which is is not allowed by the Rust abstract machine](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/95)\n 1. [`radix()` calls `MaybeUninit::assume_init()` on uninitialized data, which is is not allowed by the Rust abstract machine](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/rust-lexical/issues/126)\n\nVersion 1.0 fixes these issues, removes the vast majority of `unsafe` code, and also fixes some correctness issues.",
