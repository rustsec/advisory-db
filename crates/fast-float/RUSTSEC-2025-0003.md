# Segmentation fault due to lack of bound check
In this case, the "fast_float::common::AsciiStr::first" method within the "AsciiStr" struct 
uses the unsafe keyword to reading from memory without performing bounds checking. 
Specifically, it directly dereferences a pointer offset by "self.ptr".
Because of the above reason, the method accesses invalid memory address when it takes an empty string as its input.
This approach violates Rustâ€™s memory safety guarantees, as it can lead to invalid memory access if empty buffer is provided.

No patched version for fast-float crate has been released, but a patch is available in the fast-float2 fork.
