# ConstStaticCell could have been used to pass non-Send values to another thread

`ConstStaticCell<T>` could have been used to pass non-`Send` values to another thread, because `T` was not required to be `Send` while `ConstStaticCell` is `Send`.

This was corrected by introducing a `T: Send` bound.
