# swap_index can write out of bounds and return uninitialized memory

`swap_index` takes an iterator and swaps the items with their corresponding
indexes. It reserves capacity and sets the length of the vector based on the
`.len()` method of the iterator.

If the `len()` returned by the iterator is larger than the actual number of
elements yielded, then `swap_index` creates a vector containing uninitialized
members. If the `len()` returned by the iterator is smaller than the actual
number of members yielded, then `swap_index` can write out of bounds past
its allocated vector.

As noted by the Rust documentation, [`len()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.ExactSizeIterator.html#method.len)
and `size_hint()` are primarily meant for optimization and incorrect values
from their implementations should not lead to memory safety violations.
