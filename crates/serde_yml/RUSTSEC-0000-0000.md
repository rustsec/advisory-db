# serde_yml crate is unmaintained

The `serde_yml` crate is no longer actively maintained, after unsounded issues were raised.
If you rely on this crate, it is highly recommended switching to a maintained alternative.

## Recommended alternatives

- [`serde_norway`](https://crates.io/crates/serde_norway) - Maintained fork of `serde_yaml`, using `unsafe-libyaml-norway`
- [`serde_yaml_ng`](https://crates.io/crates/serde_yaml_ng) - Maintained fork of `serde_yaml`, using unmaintained `unsafe-libyaml`

## Incomplete alternatives

- [`serde_yaml2`](https://crates.io/crates/serde_yaml2)
- [`yaml-peg`](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-peg)
