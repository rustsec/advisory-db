# TLS certificate common name validation bypass

The NATS official Rust clients are vulnerable to MitM when using TLS.

A fix for the `nats` crate hasn't been released yet. Since the `nats` crate
is going to be deprecated anyway, consider switching to `async-nats` `>= 0.29`
which already fixed this vulnerability.

The common name of the server's TLS certificate is validated against
the `host`name provided by the server's plaintext `INFO` message
during the initial connection setup phase. A MitM proxy can tamper with
the `host` field's value by substituting it with the common name of a
valid certificate it controls, fooling the client into accepting it.

## Reproduction steps

1. The NATS Rust client tries to establish a new connection
2. The connection is intercepted by a MitM proxy
3. The proxy makes a separate connection to the NATS server
4. The NATS server replies with an `INFO` message
5. The proxy reads the `INFO`, alters the `host` JSON field and passes
   the tampered `INFO` back to the client
6. The proxy upgrades the client connection to TLS, presenting a certificate issued
   by a certificate authority present in the client's keychain.
   In the previous step the `host` was set to the common name of said certificate
7. `rustls` accepts the certificate, having verified that the common name matches the
   attacker-controlled value it was given
9. The client has been fooled by the MitM proxy into accepting the attacker-controlled certificate
