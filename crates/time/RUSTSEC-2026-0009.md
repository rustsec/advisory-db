# Denial of Service via Stack Exhaustion

When user-provided input is provided to any type that parses with the RFC 2822 format, a denial of
service attack via stack exhaustion is possible. The attack relies on formally deprecated and
rarely-used features that are part of the RFC 2822 format used in a malicious manner. Ordinary,
non-malicious input will never encounter this scenario.

# Patches

A limit to the depth of recursion was added in v0.3.47. From this version, an error will be returned
rather than exhausting the stack.

# Workarounds

Limiting the length of user input is the simplest way to avoid stack exhaustion, as the amount of
the stack consumed would be at most a factor of the length of the input.
