# Default redirect policy follows redirects to private/internal networks (SSRF)

`reqwest`'s default redirect policy (`redirect::Policy::default()`) follows up to 10 redirects without filtering redirect targets against private or internal IP ranges. This enables Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when a server-side application fetches user-controlled URLs.

An attacker who controls a URL fetched by a `reqwest`-based server application can redirect requests to:

- Cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/`) to steal IAM credentials
- Localhost services (e.g., databases, caches, admin panels on `127.0.0.1`)
- Internal network hosts (RFC 1918 addresses like `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`)

This is CWE-918. Browsers mitigate this with private network access controls, but `reqwest` provides no equivalent built-in protection.
