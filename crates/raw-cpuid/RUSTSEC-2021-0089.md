# Optional `Deserialize` implementations lacking validation

When activating the non-default feature `serialize`, most structs implement
`serde::Deserialize` without sufficient validation. This allows breaking
invariants in safe code, leading to:

* Undefined behavior in `as_string()` methods (which use
  `std::str::from_utf8_unchecked()` internally).
* Panics due to failed assertions.

See https://github.com/gz/rust-cpuid/issues/43.

A fix is not yet available, but most use cases do not require enabling
the `serialize` feature.
