# `clob-sdk` was removed from crates.io for malicious code

This is part of an ongoing campaign to attempt to typosquat crates in the
[`polymarket-client-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/polymarket-client-sdk)
ecosystem to exfiltrate user credentials.

The malicious crate had 1 version published on 2026-02-20 approximately 4 hours
before removal and had no evidence of actual downloads. There were no crates
depending on this crate on crates.io.

The crates.io team advises anyone developing with Polymarket to review
dependencies carefully. We are investigating ways to mitigate this attacker who
appears to be very motivated to steal Polymarket credentials.
