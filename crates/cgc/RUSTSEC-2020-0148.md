# Multiple soundness issues in `Ptr`

Affected versions of this crate have the following issues:

1. `Ptr` implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types, this can lead to data
   races by sending non-thread safe types across threads.

2. `Ptr::get` violates mutable alias rules by returning multiple mutable
   references to the same object.

3. `Ptr::write` uses non-atomic writes to the underlying pointer. This means
   that when used across threads it can lead to data races.
