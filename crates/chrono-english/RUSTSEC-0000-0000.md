# The maintainer of chrono-english is unresponsible

All versions will encounter compilation errors with a chrono version `>0.4.35`, due
to backward incompatible API changes.

User conradludgade reworked the original crate and created a fork with the same API
surface called [interim](https://github.com/conradludgate/interim).

The fork is better structured and passes the same test suite as chrono-english,
ensuring backward compatibility.
