# panic safety: double drop or uninitialized drop of T upon panic

Affected versions of this crate did not guard against potential panics that may happen from user-provided functions `T::default()` and `T::drop()`.

Panic within `T::default()` leads to dropping uninitialized `T`, when it is invoked from `common::Slice::<T, H>::new()`.
Panic within `T::drop()` leads to double drop of `T`, when it is invoked either from `common::SliceVec::<T, H>::resize_with()` or `common::SliceVec::<T, H>::resize()`

Either case causes memory corruption in the heap memory.
