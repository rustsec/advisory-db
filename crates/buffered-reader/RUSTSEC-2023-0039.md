# Out-of-bounds array access leads to panic

Affected versions of the crate have a bug where attacker-controlled
input can result in the use of an out-of-bound array index.  Rust
detects the use of the out-of-bound index and causes the application
to panic.  An attacker may be able to use this to cause a
denial-of-service.  However, it is not possible for an attacker to
read from or write to the application's address space.
