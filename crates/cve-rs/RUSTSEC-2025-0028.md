# cve-rs introduces memory vulnerabilities in safe Rust

`cve-rs` allows you to introduce common memory vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows and segfaults) into your Rust program in a memory safe manner.

Internally, this crate does not use unsafe code, it instead exploits a soundness bug in rustc: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860
