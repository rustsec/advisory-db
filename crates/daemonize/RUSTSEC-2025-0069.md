# `daemonize` is Unmaintained

There hasn't been any activity happening for this crate since June 3, 2023. No interactions on pull requests. Issues are disabled for the repo.

Oldest PR sitting around without any interaction from the maintainer: [knsd/daemonize#50](https://github.com/knsd/daemonize/pull/50)

On February 14, 2024, a [PR](https://github.com/knsd/daemonize/pull/57) was made to correct some UB.

Efforts to contact the crate owner via email have been unsuccessful.

## Alternatives

The [`daemonix`](https://crates.io/crates/daemonix) crate is a maintained fork of `daemonize`. `daemonix` v0.1.0 addresses the UB issue reported against the original crate, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for `daemonize` v0.5.0.
