# `ruzstd` uninit and out-of-bounds memory reads

Affected versions of `ruzstd` miscalculate the length of the allocated
and init section of its internal `RingBuffer`, leading to uninitialized
or out-of-bounds reads in `copy_bytes_overshooting` of up to 15 bytes.

This may result in up to 15 bytes of memory contents being written
into the decoded data when decompressing a crafted archive.
This may occur multiple times per archive.
