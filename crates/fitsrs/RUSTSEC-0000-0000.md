# Unsound mutable aliasing to immutable data

There are muliple cases in the codebase, like the [snippet referenced in the issue](https://github.com/cds-astro/fitsrs/blob/5609d8fbb2add2cea207f20ee89117d1f7100b87/src/hdu/data/image.rs#L43-L46), where `unsafe` is used to circumvent aliasing rules.

Immutable inputs are being cast to mutable inputs by using a combination of raw pointers and `UnsafeCell` as intermediate types.

This is undefined behaviour by itself, but in some cases also results in multiple references - some immutable and some mutable - referring to the same input.
