# Use-after-free when cloning a partially consumed `Vec` iterator

The `IntoIter` `Clone` implementation clones the whole underlying `Vec`.
If the iterator is partially consumed the consumed items will be copied, thus creating a use-after-free access.

A proof of concept is available in the original bug report.
