# Timing variability of RUSTSEC-2024-0344 also applicable to `curve25519-dalek-ng`

[`curve25519-dalek-ng`](https://crates.io/crates/curve25519-dalek-ng) is a fork of [`curve25519-dalek`](https://crates.io/crates/curve25519-dalek) that was created at a time when it was still vulnerable to the timing variability reported in [RUSTSEC-2024-0344](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0344).

Timing variability of any kind is problematic when working with  potentially secret values such as elliptic curve scalars, and such issues can potentially leak private keys and other secrets.

To patch the vulnerability, backports of
* https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/659, and
* https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/661

are required for `curve25519-dalek-ng`. For the former, [zkcrypto/curve25519-dalek-ng/pull/25](https://github.com/zkcrypto/curve25519-dalek-ng/pull/25) exists since Aug 14, 2024, but it remains open and unanswered. Because of this, to date, there is no patched version available.

Crates that use `curve25519-dalek-ng`'s `Scalar` for private key operations are also vulnerable. An example of such a crate is [`ed25519-consensus`](https://crates.io/crates/ed25519-consensus).
