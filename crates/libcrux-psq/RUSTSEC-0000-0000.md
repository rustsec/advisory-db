# Denial of service via AES-GCM decryption panic in PSQ transport layer

The `decrypt_out` method in `src/aead.rs` calls `.unwrap()` on the result of `AesGcm128::decrypt()` in the AES-GCM 128 code path. If decryption fails due to a corrupted, truncated, or maliciously crafted ciphertext, this panics and crashes the process rather than returning an error.

This code path is used by the transport layer's `read_message` function for decrypting post-handshake application data. Any PSQ ciphersuite using AES-GCM 128 (nine of the eighteen supported ciphersuites) is affected: an adversary can send a single malformed ciphertext to crash the responder process. The attack requires no authentication and no knowledge of the session keys.

The corresponding ChaCha20-Poly1305 path in the same method, as well as every other AEAD call site in the file, correctly uses `.map_err(|_| AEADError::CryptoError)?` to propagate decryption failures. The correct error handling was present on the line immediately following the `.unwrap()` but was commented out.

The maintainer blocked the reporter's GitHub account, preventing submission of a fix via pull request. A fix was published as a public commit on a fork. The maintainer later copied this same fix and pushed it independently, without issuing a security advisory.
