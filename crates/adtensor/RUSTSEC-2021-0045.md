# FromIterator implementation for Vector/Matrix can drop uninitialized memory

The `FromIterator<T>` methods for `Vector` and `Matrix` rely on the type
parameter `N` to allocate space in the iterable.

If the passed in `N` type parameter is larger than the number of items returned
by the iterator, it can lead to uninitialized memory being left in the
`Vector` or `Matrix` type which gets dropped.
