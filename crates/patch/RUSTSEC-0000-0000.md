# patch crate is unmaintained

[patch](https://crates.io/crates/patch) crate owner is unreachable. Last version published was `0.7.0` about 2 years ago.
Bugs has been reported without being addressed, including panics.

## Recommendation

The project has been forked and fixes applied:

- Repo: [https://github.com/gitpatch-rs/gitpatch](https://github.com/gitpatch-rs/gitpatch)
- Crate: [https://crates.io/crates/gitpatch](https://crates.io/crates/gitpatch)

`gitpatch` version `0.7.1` is compatible with `patch` version `0.7.0` and should be a direct replacement.
