# Create and parse non-utf8 str in `ScannerU8SliceAscii`

`ScannerU8SliceAscii` uses lots of unsafe function `from_utf8_unchecked` to directly 
convert the `[u8]` to `str` and then parse it to target type.

However, there is no validation in `ScannerU8SliceAscii::new` to guarantee the `data` 
is Ascii. So if the `ScannerU8SliceAscii` is used to scan the non-utf8 bytes, non-utf8 
str would be generated and passed it to `parse` which might lead to undefined behaviors.
