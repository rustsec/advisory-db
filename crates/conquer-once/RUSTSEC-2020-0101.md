# conquer-once's OnceCell lacks Send bound for its Sync trait.

Affected versions of `conquer-once` implements `Sync` for its `OnceCell` type
without restricting it to `Send`able types.

This allows non-`Send` but `Sync` types such as `MutexGuard` to be sent across
threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent
programs.

The issue was fixed by adding a `Send` constraint to `OnceCell`.
