# Memory Leak

The tokio-boring library in version 4.0.0 is affected by
a memory leak issue that can lead to excessive resource
consumption and potential DoS by resource exhaustion.
The set_ex_data function used by the library did not
deallocate memory used by pre-existing data in memory
each time after completing a TLS connection causing
the program to consume more resources with each new
connection.
