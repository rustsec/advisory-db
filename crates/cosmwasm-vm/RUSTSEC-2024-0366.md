# CWA-2023-004: Excessive number of function parameters in compiled Wasm

A specifically crafted Wasm file can cause the VM to consume excessive amounts of memory when compiling a contract.
This can lead to high memory usage, slowdowns, potentially a crash and can poison a lock in the VM,
preventing any further interaction with contracts.

For more information, see [CWA-2023-004](https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2023-004.md).
