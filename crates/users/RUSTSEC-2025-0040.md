# `root` appended to group listings

Affected versions append `root` to group listings, unless the correct listing
has exactly 1024 groups.

This affects both:

- The supplementary groups of a user
- The group access list of the current process

If the caller uses this information for access control, this may lead to
privilege escalation.

This crate is not currently maintained, so a patched version is not available.

Versions older than 0.8.0 do not contain the affected functions, so downgrading
to them is a workaround.

## Recommended alternatives
- [`uzers`](https://crates.io/crates/uzers) (an actively maintained fork of the `users` crate)
- [`sysinfo`](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)
