# `polymarket-clients-sdk` was removed from crates.io for malicious code

It appeared to be typosquatting existing crate
[`polymarket-client-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/polymarket-client-sdk) (`clients` vs `client`)
and attempting to steal credentials from local files.

The malicious crate had 6 versions published on 2026-02-05 and had been downloaded only 59 times.
There were no crates depending on this crate on crates.io.

Thanks to [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/) for detecting and reporting this to the crates.io team!
