# Unbounded entity expansion (Billion Laughs) in xml-rs

xml-rs supports internal DTD entity definitions and expands entity references recursively during parsing with no depth limit or expanded-size limit.

An attacker can craft an XML document with recursively defined entities (the "Billion Laughs" attack, CWE-776) that causes exponential memory consumption and CPU exhaustion. A sub-1KB XML payload can expand to gigabytes of text (~3,000,000x amplification ratio), crashing the process or host.

Any application using xml-rs to parse untrusted XML input is vulnerable.
