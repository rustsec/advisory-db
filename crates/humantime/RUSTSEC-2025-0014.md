# humantime is unmaintained

Latest `humantime` crates.io release is four years old and GitHub repository has
not seen commits in four years. Question about maintenance status has not gotten
any reaction from maintainer: https://github.com/tailhook/humantime/issues/31

# Update: maintained again

The maintainer has responded and transferred maintenance to the chronotope organization. 2.2.0 has been released.

## Possible alternatives

 * [jiff](https://crates.io/crates/jiff) provides same kind of functionality
