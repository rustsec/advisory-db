# Integer Overflow in HeaderMap::reserve() can cause Denial of Service

`HeaderMap::reserve()` used `usize::next_power_of_two()` to calculate the increased capacity.
However, `next_power_of_two()` silently overflows to 0 if given a sufficently large number
in release mode.

If the map was not empty when the overflow happens,
the library will invoke `self.grow(0)` and start infinite probing.
This allows an attacker who controls the argument to `reserve()`
to cause a potential denial of service (DoS).

The flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of `http` crate.
