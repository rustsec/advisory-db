# ButtplugFutureStateShared allows data race to (!Send|!Sync) objects

`ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` implements `Send` & `Sync` regardless of `T`.

If `T: !Send` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>`, it is possible to move non-Send types across thread boundaries (e.g. `T`=`Rc<T>`) and lead to undefined behavior.
If `T: !Sync` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>`, it is possible to cause data race to `T` (e.g. `T`=`Arc<Cell<_>>`) and lead to undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in version 1.0.4 by removing manual implementations of `Send`/`Sync` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` to let rustc generate auto trait implementations with correct trait bounds on `T`.
