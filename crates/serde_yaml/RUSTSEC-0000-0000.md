# serde_yaml crate is unmaintained

The `serde_yaml` crate is no longer actively maintained.  If you rely on this crate, consider switching to a recommended alternative.

While there are maintained forks of `serde_yaml`, none of them can be recommended as they either use the
unmaintained `unsafe-libyaml`, or they use a fork of `unsafe-libyaml` which do not resolve the underlying security problems
of `libyaml`.

## Recommended alternatives

- [`yaml-spanned`](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-spanned) - Deserializer only.
- [`serde_yaml2`](https://crates.io/crates/serde_yaml2) - Incomplete implementation of serde framework.
- [`serde-saphyr`](https://crates.io/crates/serde-saphyr) - Not complete implementation of YAML 1.2 or serde framework.
- [`yaml-peg`](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-peg) - Not complete implementation of YAML 1.2 or serde framework.
