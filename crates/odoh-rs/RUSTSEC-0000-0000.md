# Invalid Slice Split Results in Server Panic

A vulnerability was discovered in the odoh-rs rust crate that stems
from faulty logic during the parsing of encrypted queries. This
issue specifically occurs when processing encrypted query data
received from remote clients.

## Impact

An attacker with knowledge of this vulnerability could craft and send
specially designed encrypted queries to targeted ODOH servers running
with odoh-rs. Upon successful exploitation, the server will crash
abruptly, disrupting its normal operation and rendering the service
temporarily unavailable.

## Patches

Users are encouraged to update their odoh-rs's rust crate to v1.0.2.
