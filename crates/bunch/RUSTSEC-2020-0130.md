# Bunch<T> unconditionally implements Send/Sync

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for `Bunch<T>`.
This allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch<T>`. It is possible to create a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from multiple threads. It is also possible to send `T: !Send` to other threads by inserting `T` inside `Bunch<T>` and sending `Bunch<T>` to another thread, allowing to create a data race by inserting types like `T = Rc<_>`.

Such data races can lead to memory corruption.
