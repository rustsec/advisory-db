# image: Multiple Unfixed Panics and OOM in Image Decoders

The image crate contains multiple unfixed panics in its image decoder
implementations (BMP, PNG, TIFF, GIF, WebP, ICO, PNM, DDS, TGA, etc.).
Crafted image files can trigger panic!/unwrap() failures in various decoders,
causing process termination.

Open issues #2672 and #2664 document unfixed crash-inducing inputs discovered
via fuzzing. Additionally, image dimensions from file headers are trusted for
buffer allocation without configurable limits, enabling OOM-based denial of
service via crafted headers claiming extreme dimensions.

Any server-side application using the image crate to process user-uploaded
images can be crashed via crafted input.
