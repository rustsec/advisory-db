# 'merge_sort::merge()' crashes with double-free for `T: Drop`

In the affected versions of this crate, `merge_sort::merge()` wildly duplicates and drops ownership of `T` without guarding against double-free. Due to such implementation,
simply invoking `merge_sort::merge()` on `Vec<T: Drop>` can cause **double free** bugs.
