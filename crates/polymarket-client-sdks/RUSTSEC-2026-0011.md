# `polymarket-client-sdks` was removed from crates.io for malicious code

It appeared to be typosquatting existing crate
[`polymarket-client-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/polymarket-client-sdk) (`sdks` vs `sdk`)
and attempting to steal credentials from local files.

The malicious crate had 1 version published on 2026-02-09 and had been downloaded only 33 times.
There were no crates depending on this crate on crates.io.

Thanks to Roland Peelen for finding and reporting this to the crates.io team!
