# Stack-buffer-overflow in HashTable Struct
In this case, the "get_bucket" method within the HashTable struct uses the unsafe keyword to access memory with assert function protection.
However, it is still vulnerable because "bucket_count" which stands for the size of hashtable and offset value of the hashtable can be manipulated by users. 
When "bucket_count" is set bigger value than first_bucket's actual length, it can lead to invalid memory access which violates Rustâ€™s memory safety guarantees. 
Also, as hash.rs is public module, it can be used externally, which means that it is an actual vulnerability.
