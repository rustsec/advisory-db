# Unsoundness of safe `reciprocal_mg10`

The function `reciprocal_mg10` is marked as safe but can trigger undefined behavior (out-of-bounds access) because it relies on `debug_assert!` for safety checks instead of `assert!`.

When compiled in release mode, the `debug_assert!` is optimized out, potentially allowing invalid inputs to cause memory corruption.
