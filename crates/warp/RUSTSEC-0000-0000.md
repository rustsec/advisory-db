# Improper validation of Windows paths could lead to directory traversal attack

Path resolution in `warp::filters::fs::dir` didn't correctly validate Windows paths
meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed
and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users
could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.

This only impacts Windows. Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this.
