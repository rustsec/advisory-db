# Unsoundly mark unsafe functions as safe

The functions `read_u32_from_heap`, `get_output_data`, and `decode_ptr` in crate
`substreams` are unsafe since they directly operate on the pointer passed in and
have requirements for the caller.

These functions allow the caller to access memory illegally and generate undefined
`Vec` which could lead to more undefined behaviors.
