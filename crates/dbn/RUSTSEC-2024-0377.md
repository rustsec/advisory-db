# Heap Buffer overflow using c_chars_to_str function
The `heap-buffer-overflow` is triggered in the `strlen()` function when handling the `c_chars_to_str` function in the dbn crate. This vulnerability occurs because the `CStr::from_ptr()` function in Rust assumes that the provided C string is null-terminated. However, there is no guarantee that the input chars array passed to the c_chars_to_str function is properly null-terminated.

If the chars array does not contain a null byte (\0), strlen() will continue to read beyond the bounds of the buffer in search of a null terminator. This results in an out-of-bounds memory read and can lead to a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially causing memory corruption or exposing sensitive information.
