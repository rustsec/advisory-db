  "summary": "A malicious coder can get unsound access to TCell or TLCell memory",
  "details": "This is impossible to do by accident, but by carefully constructing\nmarker types to be covariant, a malicious coder can cheat the\nsingleton check in `TCellOwner` and `TLCellOwner`, giving unsound\naccess to cell memory.  This could take the form of getting two\nmutable references to the same memory, or a mutable reference and an\nimmutable reference.\n\nThe fix is for the crate to internally force the marker type to be\ninvariant.  This blocks the conversion between covariant types which\nRust normally allows.",
