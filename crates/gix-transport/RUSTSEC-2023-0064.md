# gix-transport code execution vulnerability

The `gix-transport` crate prior to the patched version 0.36.1 would allow attackers to
use malicious ssh clone URLs to pass arbitrary arguments to the `ssh` program, leading
to arbitrary code execution.

PoC: `gix clone 'ssh://-oProxyCommand=open$IFS-aCalculator/foo'`

This will launch a calculator on OSX.
