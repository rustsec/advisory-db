# ImageChunkMut needs bounds on its Send and Sync traits

In the affected versions of this crate, `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>` unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync`, allowing to create data races.

This can result in a memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries.

The flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5 by adding `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl and adding `T: Sync` bound to the `Sync` impl.
