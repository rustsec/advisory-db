# Non-aligned u32 read in Chacha20 encryption and decryption
The implementation does not enforce alignment requirements on input slices while incorrectly assuming 4-byte alignment through an unsafe call to `std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut`, which breaks the contract and introduces undefined behavior.

This affects Chacha20 encryption and decryption in crypto2.
