  "details": "Affected versions do not enforce a `Sync` bound on the type of caller-provided\nvalue held in the plugin registry. References to these values are made\naccessible to arbitrary threads other than the one that constructed them.\n\nA caller could use this flaw to submit thread-unsafe data into inventory, then\naccess it as a reference simultaneously from multiple threads.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by enforcing that data submitted by the caller into\ninventory is `Sync`.",
