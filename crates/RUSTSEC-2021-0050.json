  "summary": "swap_index can write out of bounds and return uninitialized memory",
  "details": "`swap_index` takes an iterator and swaps the items with their corresponding\nindexes. It reserves capacity and sets the length of the vector based on the\n`.len()` method of the iterator.\n\nIf the `len()` returned by the iterator is larger than the actual number of\nelements yielded, then `swap_index` creates a vector containing uninitialized\nmembers. If the `len()` returned by the iterator is smaller than the actual\nnumber of members yielded, then `swap_index` can write out of bounds past\nits allocated vector.\n\nAs noted by the Rust documentation, [`len()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.ExactSizeIterator.html#method.len)\nand `size_hint()` are primarily meant for optimization and incorrect values\nfrom their implementations should not lead to memory safety violations.\n\n\n# Patch\n\nA new version crate was pushed that marks this function as unsafe.\n\nreorder = \"1.1.0\"\n\nPrevious versions have also been yanked from crates.io.",
