# Uninitialized read after allocating MemBump

The affected function, `MemBump::new()`, would allocate memory without
initializing it. Subsequently calling the created value's various `alloc`
methods would then read and write the start of that memory as a `Cell` which is
undefined behavior. Instead, it should zero initialize the start of the
allocated memory.

For instance, some values could violate the internal invariants of the type and
cause an assertion failure. Nevertheless, no deterministic read is known to
cause further uninitialized memory to be exposed.

Affected downstream users that can not upgrade are advised to call
`MemBump::reset` immediately after allocation to manually perform the missing
write of the counter best-as-possible.

The flaw was corrected in commit d8d6a7d096d3aaafd963b356a8f1bbd8d26fd967 by
zeroing the Cell at the start of the allocated memory.
