# Logs AWS credentials when TRACE-level logging is enabled

aws-sigv4 is a rust library for low level request signing in the aws cloud platform.

The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation.
When debug-formatted, it would include a user's AWS access key, AWS secret key,
and security token in plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK,
`SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to anyone
with access to logs.

All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who enabled TRACE-level logging,
either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`), or for the `aws-sigv4`
crate specifically are affected.

This issue has been addressed in a set of new releases.

Users are advised to upgrade.

Users unable to upgrade should disable TRACE-level logging for AWS Rust SDK crates.
