# `IterMut` violates Stacked Borrows by invalidating internal pointer

Affected versions of this crate contain a soundness issue in the `IterMut`
iterator implementation. The `IterMut::next` and `IterMut::next_back`
methods temporarily create an exclusive reference to the key when
dereferencing the internal node pointer.

This invalidates the shared pointer held by the internal `HashMap`,
violating Stacked Borrows rules.
