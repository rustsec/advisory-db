# Potential undefined behavior when dereferencing Buf struct 

if we dereference the Buf struct right after calling new() or default() on Buf struct, it passes Null Pointer to the unsafe function slice::from_raw_parts. Based on the safety section documentation of function,
data must be non-null and aligned even for zero-length slices or slices of ZSTs. Thus, passing Null Pointer will lead to undefined behavior.
