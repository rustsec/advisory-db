# Pointer Offset Overflow in onig

A pointer offset overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the Region::pos method of the rust-onig library. The method performs an unchecked conversion from usize to isize, which can lead to address calculation overflow in the subsequent ptr::offset operation.

Crash Information:
Error Type: unsafe precondition(s) violated: ptr::offset requires the address calculation to not overflow
Location: region.rs in Region::pos
Root Cause: Conversion of usize values greater than isize::MAX to isize causes integer overflow
