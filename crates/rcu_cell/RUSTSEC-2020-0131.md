# Send/Sync bound needed on T  for Send/Sync impl of RcuCell<T>

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `RcuCell<T>`.
This allows users to send `T: !Send` to other threads (while `T` enclosed within `RcuCell<T>`), and allows users to concurrently access `T: !Sync` by using the APIs of `RcuCell<T>` that provide access to `&T`.

This can result in memory corruption caused by data races.
