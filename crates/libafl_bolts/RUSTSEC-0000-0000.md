# Out-of-bounds access in covmap_is_interesting functions

The safe functions `covmap_is_interesting_simd` and `covmap_is_interesting_naive` can cause undefined behavior through out-of-bounds memory access.

Both functions use `get_unchecked` to access the `hist` slice with indices based on the `map` slice length. When `hist.len() < map.len()`, this results in out-of-bounds access causing undefined behavior.
