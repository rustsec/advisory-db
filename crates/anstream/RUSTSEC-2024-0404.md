# Unsoundness in anstream

When given a valid UTF8 string "Ã¶\x1bðŸ˜€", the function in
crates/anstream/src/adapter/strip.rs will be confused. The UTF8
bytes are \xc3\xb6 then \x1b then \xf0\x9f\x98\x80.

When looping over "non-printable bytes" \x1b\xf0 will be
considered as some non-printable sequence.

This will produce a broken str from the incorrectly segmented
bytes via str::from_utf8_unchecked, and that should never happen.

Full credit goes to @Ralith who reviewed this code and
asked @burakemir to follow up.
