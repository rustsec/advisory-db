# DoS vulnerability on `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` hashing

An uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) when the library is used in auto-restarting software.

The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version [v1.4.1](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/1.4.1) and backported to [v0.8.26](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/0.8.26).

There is no known workaround that mitigates the vulnerability. Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended course of action.
