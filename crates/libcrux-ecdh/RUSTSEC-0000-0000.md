# X25519 secret validation did not check buffer length or clamping

The latest releases of the libcrux-ecdh crate contains the following
bug-fix:

[#1301](https://github.com/cryspen/libcrux/pull/1301): Check length
and clamping in X25519 secret validation. This is a breaking change
since errors are now raised on unclamped X25519 secrets or inputs of
the wrong length
