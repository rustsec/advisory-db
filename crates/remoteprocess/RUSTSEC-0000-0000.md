# Multiple soundness issues in ProcessMemory trait

Safe methods in the `ProcessMemory` trait can cause double-free and use-after-free bugs when used with non-Copy types.

The methods `copy_struct`, `copy_pointer`, and `copy_vec` perform bitwise copies of memory without enforcing that the copied type is safe to duplicate. This allows creating multiple owned copies of non-POD types (e.g., types containing `String` or `Vec`), leading to double-free when both copies are dropped.

Fixed by adding `Copy` trait bounds to ensure only trivially copyable types can be used with these methods.
