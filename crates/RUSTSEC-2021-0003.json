  "summary": "Buffer overflow in SmallVec::insert_many",
  "details": "A bug in the `SmallVec::insert_many` method caused it to allocate a buffer that was smaller than needed.  It then wrote past the end of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow and memory corruption on the heap.\n\nThis bug was only triggered if the iterator passed to `insert_many` yielded more items than the lower bound returned from its `size_hint` method.\n \nThe flaw was corrected in smallvec 0.6.14 and 1.6.1, by ensuring that additional space is always reserved for each item inserted.  The fix also simplified the implementation of `insert_many` to use less unsafe code, so it is easier to verify its correctness.\n\nThank you to Yechan Bae (@Qwaz) and the Rust group at Georgia Tech’s SSLab for finding and reporting this bug.",
