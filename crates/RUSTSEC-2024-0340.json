  "summary": "Tor path lengths too short when \"full Vanguards\" configured",
  "details": "## Description\n\nWhen building anonymizing circuits to or from an onion service with \nfull vanguards enabled, \nthe circuit manager code would build the circuits with one hop too few.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis makes users of this code more vulnerable to some kinds of traffic analysis\nwhen they run or visit onion services.\n\n## Vulnerable configurations and use cases\n\nArti configured with \"full vangaurds\" is vulnerable.\n\nOnly users who make connections to Onion Services\n(Tor Hidden Services) are affected.\nNote, however, that when used as a browser proxy,\nmalicious web pages can typically make such connections.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nPreventing access to Tor Hidden Services will avoid the problem,\nwith corresponding loss of functionality.\nThis can be achieved in the Arti configuration file with:\n\n```\n[address_filter]\nallow_onion_addrs = false\n```\n\nChanging the configuration (eg to turn off vanguards)\nreclassifies the behaviour as \"as configured\",\nbut reduces security rather than improving it,\nso is not a mitigation.\n\n## Resolution\n\nRebuild `arti` (or other affected applications)\nwith a fixed version of `tor-circmgr`:\n0.18.1 or later.\n\nThe fixed `tor-circmgr` is on crates.io and available in\n[the upstream git repository](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti)\nat signed tag `arti-v1.2.3`.\n\n### Note about older versions\n\nEven though earlier versions are classified as \"not affected\",\nthis is because in those versions the Vanguards feature\nis experimental, or absent.\nDowngrading worsens security, rather than improving it.\n\n## References\n\n * [arti#1400](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/1400):\n   the ticket in the Arti bugtracker.\n * [TROVE](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/team/-/wikis/NetworkTeam/TROVE)\n   Tor Project vulnerability database.\n * [arti#1409](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/1409):\n   the similar bug with the vanguards lite feature.",
