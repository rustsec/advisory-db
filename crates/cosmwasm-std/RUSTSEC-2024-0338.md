# Arithmetic overflows in cosmwasm-std

Some mathematical operations in `cosmwasm-std` use wrapping math instead of
panicking on overflow for very big numbers. This can lead to wrong calculations in contracts
that use these operations.

Affected functions:

- `Uint{256,512}::pow` / `Int{256,512}::pow`
- `Int{256,512}::neg`

Affected if `overflow-checks = true` is not set:

- `Uint{64,128}::pow` / `Int{64,128}::pow`
- `Int{64,128}::neg`
