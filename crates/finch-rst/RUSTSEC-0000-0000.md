# `finch-rst` was removed from crates.io for malicious code

This attempts to typosquat the existing crate
[`finch`](https://crates.io/crates/finch) to steal credentials from local
files.

The malicious crate had 1 version published on 2025-12-08 and had been
downloaded 21 times. There were no crates depending on this crate on crates.io.

Thanks to Matthias Zepper of [NGI Sweden](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) for
reporting this to the crates.io team!
