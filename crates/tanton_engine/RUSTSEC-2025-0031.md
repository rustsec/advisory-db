# Unsound public API in unmaintained crate

The following functions in the `tanton_engine` crate are unsound due to lack of sufficient boundary
checks in public API:

- `Stack::offset()`
- `ThreadStack::get()`
- `RootMoveList::insert_score_depth()`
- `RootMoveList::insert_score()`

The tanton_engine crate is no longer maintained, so there are no plans to fix this issue.
