# Threshold value is ignored (all shares are n=3)

Affected versions of this crate did not properly calculate secret shares requirements.

This reduces the security of the algorithm by restricting the crate to always
using a threshold value of three, rather than a configurable limit.

The flaw was corrected by correctly configuring the threshold.
