# Incorrect usage of `#[repr(packed)]`

The affected versions make unsafe memory accesses under the assumption that `#[repr(packed)]` has a guaranteed field order. 

The Rust specification does not guarantee this, and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125360 (1.80.0-beta) starts 
reordering fields of `#[repr(packed)]` structs, leading to illegal memory accesses.

The patched versions `0.9.7` and `0.10.3` use `#[repr(C, packed)]`, which guarantees field order.
