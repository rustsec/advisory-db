# Out-of-bounds array access leads to panic

Affected versions of the crate have several bugs where
attacker-controlled input can result in the use of an out-of-bound
array index.  Rust detects the use of the out-of-bound index and
causes the application to panic.  An attacker may be able to use this
to cause a denial-of-service.  However, it is not possible for an
attacker to read from or write to the application's address space.
