# Multiple memory safety issues

Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:

 - Setting a multi label type where an image doesn't exist would lead to a NULL pointer dereference.
 - Setting a window icon using a non-raster image (which FLTK rasterizes lazily) would lead to a NULL dereference.
 - Pixmap constructor would not check for correct pixmaps which could lead to out-of bound reads.
