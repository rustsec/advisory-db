# matrix-sdk-base: Denial of service due to custom `m.room.join_rules` events 

The matrix-sdk-base crate is unable to handle responses that include custom
m.room.join_rules values due to a serialization bug.

This can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition, if a user is
invited to a room with non-standard join rules, the crate's sync process will
stall, preventing further processing for all rooms.
