# AtomicBox<T> lacks bound on its Send and Sync traits allowing data races

`AtomicBox<T>` is a `Box` type designed to be used across threads, however, it
implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types `T`.

This allows non-Send types such as `Rc` and non-Sync types such as `Cell` to
be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and
memory corruption.
