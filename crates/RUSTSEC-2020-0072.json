  "summary": "GenericMutexGuard allows data races of non-Sync types across threads",
  "details": "`GenericMutexGuard<T>` was given the `Sync` auto trait as long as `T` is `Send`\ndue to its contained members. However, since the guard is supposed to represent\nan **acquired lock** and allows concurrent access to the underlying data from\ndifferent threads, it should only be `Sync` when the underlying data is.\n\nThis is a soundness issue and allows data races, potentially leading to crashes\nand segfaults from safe Rust code.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by adding a `T: Send + Sync` bound for\n`GenericMutexGuard`'s `Sync` trait.\n\nThis bug is [similar to one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41622) in\n`std::sync::Mutex`.",
