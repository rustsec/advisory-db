# `libyml::string::yaml_string_extend` is unsound and unmaintained

In version 0.0.4, `libyml::string::yaml_string_extend` was revised resulting in undefined behaviour, which is unsound.

The GitHub project for `libyml` was archived after unsoundness issues were raised.

If you rely on this crate, it is highly recommended switching to a maintained alternative.
