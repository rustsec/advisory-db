# The kstring integration in gix-attributes is unsound

gix-attributes (in [state::ValueRef](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-attributes/src/state.rs#L19-L27)) unsafely creates a `&str` from a `&[u8]` containing non-UTF8 data, with the justification that so long as nothing reads the &str and relies on it being UTF-8 in the &str, there is no UB:

```rust
// SAFETY: our API makes accessing that value as `str` impossible, so illformed UTF8 is never exposed as such.
```

The problem is that the non-UTF8 `str` **is** exposed to outside code: first to the `kstring` crate itself, which requires UTF-8 in its documentation and may have UB as a consequence of this, but also to `serde`, where it propagates to e.g. `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, etc., where the same problems occur.

As far as I know, this is not sound, and either is or can cause UB down the line in these places that can view the `&str`.
