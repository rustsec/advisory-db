# Some lock_api lock guard objects can cause data races

Affected versions of lock_api had unsound implementations of the `Send` or
`Sync` traits for some guard objects, namely:

* MappedMutexGuard
* MappedRwLockReadGuard
* MappedRwLockWriteGuard
* RwLockReadGuard
* RwLockWriteGuard

These guards could allow data races through types that are not safe to `Send`
across thread boundaries in safe Rust code.

This issue was fixed by changing the trait bounds on the `Mapped` guard types
and removing the `Sync` trait for the `RwLock` guards.
