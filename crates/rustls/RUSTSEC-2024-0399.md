# rustls network-reachable panic in `Acceptor::accept`

A bug introduced in rustls 0.23.13 leads to a panic if the received
TLS ClientHello is fragmented.  Only servers that use
`rustls::server::Acceptor::accept()` are affected.

Servers that use `tokio-rustls`'s `LazyConfigAcceptor` API are affected.

Servers that use `tokio-rustls`'s `TlsAcceptor` API are not affected.

Servers that use `rustls-ffi`'s `rustls_acceptor_accept` API are affected.
