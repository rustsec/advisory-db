# Pingora Request Smuggling and Cache Poisoning

Pingora versions prior to 0.5.0 which used the caching functionality in pingora-proxy did not properly drain the downstream request body on cache hits.

This allows an attacker to craft malicious HTTP/1.1 requests which could lead to request smuggling or cache poisoning.

This flaw was corrected in commit fda3317ec822678564d641e7cf1c9b77ee3759ff by ensuring that the downstream request body is always drained before a connection can be reused.
