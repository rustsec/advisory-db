# Denial of service on EVM execution due to memory over-allocation

Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related
to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the `evm`
crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it
possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack.

The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`.
