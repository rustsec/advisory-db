  "summary": "Missing check in ZK proof in CGGMP21 Threshold Signing Protocol",
  "details": "Vulnerability concerns a missing check in the ZK proof that enables an attack in which single malicious signer can reconstruct full private key.\n\n### Patches\n* `cggmp21 v0.6.3` is a patch release that contains a fix that introduces this specific missing check.\n* However, we recommend upgrading to `cggmp24 v0.7.0-alpha.2` in which we've introduced many other security checks as a precaution. Follow the [migration guidelines](https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/cggmp21/blob/v0.7.0-alpha.2/CGGMP21_MIGRATION.md) to upgrade.\n\n### References\nRead our [blog post](https://www.dfns.co/article/cggmp21-vulnerabilities-patched-and-explained) to learn more.",
