# Dump Undefined Memory by `JitDumpFile`

The unsound function `dump_code_load_record` uses `from_raw_parts` to directly convert 
the pointer `addr` and `len` into a slice without any validation and that memory block 
would be dumped.

Thus, the 'safe' function dump_code_load_record is actually 'unsafe' since it requires 
the caller to guarantee that the addr is valid and len must not overflow.
Otherwise, the function could dump the memory into file illegally, causing memory leak.
