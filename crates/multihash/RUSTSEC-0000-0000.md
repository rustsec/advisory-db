# Unexpected panic in multihash `from_slice` parsing code

In versions prior 0.11.3 it's possible to make `from_slice` panic by feeding it certain malformed input.
It's never documented that `from_slice` (and `from_bytes` which wraps it) can panic, and its' return type (`Result<Self, DecodeError>`) suggests otherwise.

In practice, `from_slice`/`from_bytes` is frequently used in networking code (for example [in rust-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/7b415d5e7040e45c541f76f2c409e63d4d3249c6/core/src/peer_id.rs#L89)) and is being called with unsanitized data from untrusted sources.
This can allow attackers to cause DoS by causing an unexpected `panic` in the network client's code.
