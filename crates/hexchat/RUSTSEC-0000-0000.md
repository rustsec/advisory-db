# hexchat crate is unsound and unmaintained

All versions of this crate have function `deregister_command` which can result in use after free.
This is unsound.

In addition, all versions since 0.3.0 have "safe" macros, which are documented as unsafe to use in threads.

In addition, the `hexchat` crate is no longer actively maintained.  If you rely on this crate, consider switching to a recommended alternative.
